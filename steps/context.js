 *
 * The shape of the whole thing, because it is the part worth getting right:
 *
 *   1. Sign in (the caller does this) and pick a project.
 *   2. Ask the project what it already knows, and when it last read THIS repo.
 *   3. Extract, here, in the developer's own agent. The repository never
 *      leaves the machine.
 *   4. Second pass: a fresh model call that sees only the extracted text, plus
 *      a set of deterministic rules. Anything either one flags is dropped and
 *      named on the terminal, so the developer can see the pass working
 *      without the offending text going anywhere.
 *   5. Show what survived, ask, upload. The server runs its own adversarial
 *      review before anything is stored, and everything lands as pending.
 *
 * Re-running is the normal case, not the exception. A second run diffs against
 * the commit the last one recorded and only reads what changed, which is why
 * the whole thing is cheap enough to put in a habit or a CI job.
