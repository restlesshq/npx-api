/**
 * The rules that don't depend on a model behaving.
 *
 * `context` runs three checks before a candidate can reach the inbox, and this
 * is the middle one:
 *
 *   1. the extraction pass, on this machine, told to write only public docs;
 *   2. a redaction pass - an independent model call that sees ONLY the
 *      extracted text, plus this module;
 *   3. an adversarial safety review on the server, by a different model.
 *
 * Steps 1 and 3 are judgement. This is arithmetic. A model that has been
 * reading a private codebase for ten minutes is exactly the thing you cannot
 * ask "did you leak anything?", so the patterns most likely to end a career -
 * a live key, an internal hostname, a customer's email - are matched here,
 * where behaviour is not a variable.
 *
 * Everything it catches is DROPPED, never redacted. A candidate with its
 * secret starred out still tells the reader that there is a secret, what it is
 * called, and where it lives, and the fact it was worth mentioning at all
 * means the extraction misunderstood the job. The caller reports what was
 * dropped locally, so the pass is visible without the text going anywhere.
 *
 * A LEAF module: no imports at all.
 */

/**
 * Each rule is [name, regex, why]. Ordered roughly by how bad it would be.
 *
 * These are deliberately blunt. A false positive costs one withheld sentence,
 * which the developer sees named in the summary and can re-word; a false
 * negative is on the public internet.
