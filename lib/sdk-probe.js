 * what that costs when it goes wrong: users reported the Configure SDK step
 * "got stuck" because a synchronous walk froze the UI with no spinner update,
 * no cursor, no message.
 *
 * The per-call timeout does not bound that. Ruby tries three commands and
 * Python up to six interpreters, so a machine where each one hangs to its own
 * limit stacks them: 3 x 20s of dead terminal for Ruby, and `bundle list` on a
 * cold Rails app is genuinely slow enough to reach it. A budget shared across
 * the attempts bounds what the user actually experiences, which is the whole
 * sequence, not any single call.
 *
 * A LEAF module: the writers import it, so it must not import the registry.
